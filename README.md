# index-responsive-forms
An index of two forms. Part of the class challenges of Rocketseat.


This project is an amalgamation of a class challenge plus some improvements considering navigation between pages and responsiveness.

It consists in 3 pages:

Index.html: considered the main/initial page of the application, there's a navigation for the other pages here.

Form1.html: the first form. Used to request a new mentorship.

Form2.html: the second first. Used to evaluate a mentorship.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The responsiveness is made using @media in the css files, by visualizing the effects of different screen sizes.

Consider that every page has 2 different files, with style.css present in all of them, sharing the :root properties.
